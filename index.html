      You don’t need to be three-dimensional to be full of life inside the walls
      of Hogwarts.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hogwarts, like any self-respecting old building, is full of works of art.
      They adorn the stairwells and line the walls of the Headmaster’s office –
      gilt-framed and larger than life. The most convincing examples of the
      artistic school of realism ever, Hogwarts portraits are imbued with the
      memories and emotions of their subjects: they sidle between frames and
      interact with the living, spending their time drinking, singing, shouting
      and generally seeming to have a better time with their legs painted on
      than we’ve ever managed in real life. In the Muggle world, portraits are
      often as much about the artists as they are about the subjects; in the
      wizarding world it’s all about those portrayed in paint. These are the
      portraits with the biggest influence on the action:

        <h3>The Fat Lady</h3>
        <article>
          The Fat Lady The Fat Lady, clad in a floor-length gown, and charged
          with the important task of guarding the door to the Gryffindor common
          room, leads a life of decadence and delight. Alternately depicted
          singing, necking whole casks of wine and socialising with her posse,
          she knows the value of a liqueur chocolate and a tinsel headband. She
          might be a fan of the finer things in life, but she suffers at the
          hands of Sirius Black, when she refuses him admission to the common
          room. Two parts sarcasm and one-part whiskey, she’s the portrait with
          the most staying power, making regular appearances throughout the
          novels, always equipped with top-notch passwords such as ‘banana
          fritters’, ‘baubles’ and (after some festive over-indulgence)
          ‘abstinence’. Of all the animated oil paint, she’s the most human. She
          celebrates wins with the Gryffindors; she mourns Dumbledore’s death.
          And since the levels of activity of the portrait is a direct
          reflection of the powers of the witch or wizard in life, we’re sad we
          never got to know her in the flesh. She’d have really enjoyed the
          Three Broomsticks. ‘I’ve got something for you, Harry,’ said Hermione,
          neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him.
          ‘Oh, hang on – password. Abstinence.’ ‘Precisely,’ said the Fat Lady
          in a feeble voice, and swung forwards to reveal the portrait hole.
          ‘What’s up with her?’ asked Harry. ‘Overindulged over Christmas,
          apparently,’ said Hermione, rolling her eyes as she led the way into
          the packed common room. ‘She and her friend Violet drank their way
          through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms
          corridor. Anyway…’ Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

        <h3>Ariana Dumbledore</h3>
        <article>
          The youngest Dumbledore is never present as a ghost, but her spirit is
          everywhere, haunting Albus Dumbledore throughout his life. It makes
          sense, then, that it’s her portrait that provides Harry with his most
          pivotal return to Hogwarts, concealing the passageway between
          Aberforth’s house and the Room of Requirement. She’s nothing but
          memory, reflection, paint on canvas: an ever-present reminder of the
          impossibility of restoring what once was lost. Ariana’s portrait,
          described as nothing more than blonde with ‘vacant sweetness’, never
          speaks, unlike the garrulous occupants of most of Hogwarts’ paintings.
          Deceased long before the events of the books, she is the silent
          catalyst, the unspoken regret, the family secret. Aberforth remained
          fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so
          extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared his throat, got
          to his feet, walked around the little table and approached the
          portrait of Ariana. ‘You know what to do,’ he said. She smiled, turned
          and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, out of the
          sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel
          painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until
          finally she was swallowed by the darkness. Harry Potter and the
          Deathly Hallows

        <h3>Sir Cadogan</h3>
        <article>
          This portly knight makes his first appearance in Harry Potter and the
          Prisoner of Azkaban, when he aids Harry and Ron in finding their first
          Divination class. Though he’s clearly committed to his knightly duty
          to aid those in need, he’s not exactly what you would call competent.
          All over-long sword and grass-stained knees, he spends more time
          trying to get back on his pony than he does rescuing damsels in
          distress. Still, you can’t say that he’s not brave: when the Fat
          Lady’s canvas is slashed to strips by one knife-happy Sirius Black,
          it’s his portrait that takes her place guarding the Gryffindor common
          room, with its precious Harry-shaped cargo (leaving aside the fact
          that he subsequently cheerfully admits Sirius through, when he comes
          equipped with Neville’s list of passwords). Cadogan’s last appearance
          is during The Battle of Hogwarts, when he accompanies Harry on a mad
          dash through the corridors, shouting encouragement, ready for battle
          to the last. ‘Farewell!’ cried the knight, popping his head into a
          painting of some sinister-looking monks. ‘Farewell, my
          comrades-in-arms! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely
          sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!’ ‘Yeah, we’ll call you,’ muttered Ron,
          as the knight disappeared, ‘if we ever need someone mental.’ Harry

          scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!’ Harry Potter

        <h3>Phineas Nigellus Black</h3>
        <article>
          An ex-Headmaster of Hogwarts and Slytherin to his oil-paint core,
          Phineas hangs in the Headmaster’s office and represents the silly side
          of evil. He feigns sleep when Dumbledore calls upon him, and speaks
          only to reinforce his intense dislike for Harry Potter, all
          Gryffindors, and more or less everyone without the surname Black. He
          plays an important role in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,
          as his other painting adorns the dirty walls of 12 Grimmauld Place. He
          therefore serves as an unwilling messenger for the Order. A wearer of
          silk gloves and admirer of style, the child-loathing ex-teacher is
          extremely well-endowed with personality and pride, if not with charm.
          He might be deliberately loathsome, but he’s also capable of words of
          wisdom, and his sneering disregard for Harry is what enables him to
          give Harry an essential talking-to when he verges on breaking down
          ‘You know,’ said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry, ‘this
          is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so
          infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything.
          Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there
          might be an excellent reason why the Headmaster of Hogwarts is not
          confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never
          paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following
          Dumbledore’s orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all
          young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you
          alone recognise danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to
          realise what the Dark Lord may be planning –’ ‘He is planning
          something to do with me, then?’ said Harry swiftly. ‘Did I say that?’
          said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk gloves. ‘Now, if you
          will excuse me, I have better things to do than listen to adolescent
          agonising … good-day to you.’ Harry Potter and the Order of the
          Phoenix

        <h3>The Provocative Mermaid</h3>
        <article>
          Just because she doesn’t get given a name doesn’t mean this scaled
          siren doesn’t play an important role among the framed alumni of
          Hogwarts. Given prime position in the prefect’s bathroom, the mermaid
          spends her time flirting with the finer prefect specimens as they
          wallow in their flashy swimming-pool-sized tub. While it can’t be
          ideal to be an aquatic creature left high and dry, she certainly knows
          how to make the best of her situation. Harry’s eyes had fallen on the
          picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall. ‘Myrtle, there aren’t
          merpeople in there, are there?’ ‘Oooh, very good,’ she said, her thick
          glasses twinkling. ‘It took Diggory much longer than that! And that
          was with her awake, too – Myrtle jerked her head towards the mermaid
          with an expression of great dislike on her glum face – ‘giggling and
          showing off and flashing her fins...’ Harry Potter and the Goblet of

        <h3>Violet</h3>
        <article>
          Best pal to the Fat Lady, Violet doesn’t seem to do much more
          with her second life than imbibe fine wine and indulge in lengthy
          gossip sessions with her friend. An icon to us all. ‘Well, well,
          well,’ said the Fat Lady, ‘Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s
          just been chosen as school champion, then?’ ‘Balderdash,’ said Harry
          dully. ‘It most certainly isn’t!’ said the pale witch indignantly. ‘
          No, no, Vi, it’s the password,’ said the Fat Lady soothingly, and she
          swung forwards on her hinges to let Harry into the common room. Harry
          Potter and the Goblet of Fire Cumulatively, the canvas occupants of
          Hogwarts play a key role in events that transpire, from protection to
          betrayal – human to the end. I hope that any future portraits capture
          McGonagall’s raised-eyebrow wrath, Sirius’ sardonic humour and Harry’s
          bravery. It’s reassuring to know that there are multiple ways that our
          favourites might live on in death, whether it be as portrait or ghost,
          or both.
