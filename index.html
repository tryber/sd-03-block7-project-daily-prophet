                <div class="textOtherRight article-animation">>The Battle of Hogwarts was the last battle of the Second Wizarding War. The battle began on May 1 and ended on May 2, 1998, inside the castle and on the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Lord Voldemort learned that Harry Potter was at the castle to locate and destroy one of his last horcruxes, He told every Death Eater and every creature that was loyal to him to attack the school. It was the most devastating battle of the war, with fatalities including Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange, but also Remus Lupine, Ninfadora Tonks, Severus Snape, Fred Weasley, Colin Creevey and at least fifty others who fought against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.</div>
                <div class="textOthersLeft article-animation">Sirius Black's escape was, to say the least, legendary. In 1993, he became the first person to escape from the Azkaban wizards' prison. After several Azkaban years, Sirius managed to recover enough energy to transform himself into an Animagus and escape from prison.</div>
