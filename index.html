                    What kind of bundles are these? Were they a more skillful sort of muggle? What would be the magic they do? These and many other questions are discussed with leading authorities in the field of modern Muggle studies. Is it possible that Muggles are not very different from ourselves? In fact, can we learn from our cousins' evolution?

                    Coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause respiratory infections. The new coronavirus agent was discovered on 12/31/19 after cases registered in China. It causes the disease called coronavirus (COVID-19).

                    The first human coronaviruses were isolated for the first time in 1937. However, it was in 1965 that the virus was described as coronavirus, due to the profile under microscopy, looking like a crown.

                    Most people are infected with common coronaviruses throughout their lives, with young children being more likely to become infected with the most common type of the virus. The most common coronaviruses that infect humans are alpha coronavirus 229E and NL63 and beta coronavirus OC43, HKU1.

                    The Minister of Magic, Hermione Granger, asks all wizards to remain calm, to inform them about how to behave in front of Muggles and to look for St. Mungus Hospital for Illness and Magic Accidents if they have any symptoms.
